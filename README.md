# fullMedMobile
# Note, this is a fullstack mobile beta health app which is in beta and still # # under construction :|

# You can view all screens via the mobileScreenShots Directory and they
# are listed by number

# For simplicity, I have started the app on the homepage so you do not 
# need to install mongodb or run the backend server, but the code for the mini
# backend is in the "auth-server" directory.

# To run the mobile app, "npm install" <--install dependencies-->
# Then simply run "npm run start"
